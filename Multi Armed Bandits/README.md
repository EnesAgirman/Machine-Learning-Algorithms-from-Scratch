# Explore Then Commit Algorithm and Epsilon Greedy Algorithm for Multi Armed Bandits

We have 2 arms where arm 1 and arm 2 generating i.i.d. samples from Bernoulli distri-
butions, resp., Ber(0.4) and Ber(0.8).

## Explore Then Commit Algorithm
We use the explore then commit algorithm with T=500 and experiment various N values to see which one performs the best.
We experiment with: N = 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 41, and 46.

We repeat this experiment for 1000 times and take the average of these 1000 experiment to get rid of the noise

## Epsilon Greedy Algorithm

We use the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm with T=500 and experiment various N values to see which one performs the best.
We experiment with: N = 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 41, and 46.
