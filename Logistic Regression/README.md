# Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset

Here, I basically implemented a 1 layer neural network or perceptron algorithm to do classification on the mnist dataset

The data is given in the "data" folder. 

PCA.ipynb file is used to do principal component analysis to the dataset. It uses q1_script.py for helping functions

MNIST_Classifier.ipynb is used to define the models and classify the images and show the results. It uses q2_script.py for helping functions
